Place the AddonPedsPack folder into your FiveM server's 'resources' folder
add 'ensure AddonPedsPack' to your server.cfg
then if you use a mod menu like vMenu, you can copy the list of addon peds directly from 'vMenu-Addons-List.txt into your vMenu addons.json file

REASON FOR FORK: The original creation didn't work when just placed into the resources and added to the server.cfg
Changes: I moved things around and changed the __resource.lua file to make things work as a FiveM-Ready addon would be expected to.
